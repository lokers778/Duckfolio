# Duckfolio

Duckfolio is my simple React portfolio project, helping me understand basic of React like state or props. This will contain 5 app (currently only 3 working) to show my understanding. In one section i will link my another projects and in another i will give little description about me my knowledge state ot future plans.  
  
  ## Project Section
  1.Header and footer - they are static elements, header contains navlink with React Router that will generate main section
    
  2.Main - main section, you can find there gallery, about me page with little description about my skills, my persona and project. And you can find my simple React apps.
    
  2.1 . My simple React apps :  
  2.1.1 To Do list - basic to do with filter tasks function  
  2.2.2 Meme Generator - fetching images from api and generate some text on them  
  2.2.3 React Chat - my biggest project here, simple react chat which I create with chatkit library 
  2.2.4 Unsplash gallery - grid gallery, ajax with axio
  2.2.5 ??? - my last app, still working on it
  
  2.2 Other projects - that section contains links to my other project  
  
  2.3 Contact - you can find link to my github linkedin and form to contact me
  
## Road map
 1. Add last App
 2.Rebuild app with DRY    
 3.Add style for 404  
 4.Work with another projects and link them
